Measuro
=======

Measuro: A fast, easy-to-use header library for creating program metrics in 
modern C++.

Comprehensive Measuro documentation - including guidance for developers and
code examples - is located at:
<https://measuro.readthedocs.io/en/0.1.0/>

Key Features
------------

- Header-only library written in pure C++14 with no external runtime 
  dependencies
- An intuitive, thread-safe interface for manipulating numeric, string and 
  boolean metrics
- Sum numeric metrics together automatically using the special 'sum' metric 
  type
- Calculate the rate of change of a numeric metric automatically using the 
  special 'rate' metric type
- Minimise the performance impact of frequent metric updates using built-in 
  rate limiting options
- Easily output metrics in custom formats using the simple Renderer interface,
  or use the built-in plain text and JSON renderers
- Schedule asynchronous metric render operations to automatically write 
  formatted metrics to an output stream at regular intervals

Getting Started
---------------

**Prerequisites**

To use Measuro in your application you will need at minimum:

- cmake >= 2.6
- A fully-compliant C++14 compiler - g++ 6.1 or above recommended. Measuro has 
  not been tested with other compilers (though it will probably be easy to get 
  building in those that have implemented the standard).

  If you are using a version of g++ < 6.1, you will need to supply the 
  ``-std=c++14`` switch to enable C++14 mode.

It's recommended that you use the Measuro build system to generate a 
development package you can install using your system package manager. To do 
this you will need package building tools such as rpm-build or builddeb.

To run the Measuro test suite you will need:

- C++14 compiler, as above
- cmake >= 2.6
- gtest development package (unit testing framework)
- valgrind, for dynamic analysis
- cppcheck, for static analysis
- Python >= 2.6

**Installing**

It's recommended that you generate a development package to install on your 
system. To do this on an RPM-based system, from the repository root::

    $ cmake ./ -DCPACK_GENERATOR=RPM

To do this on a DEB-based system, from the repository root::

    $ cmake ./ -DCPACK_GENERATOR=DEB

Then::

    $ make package

A package file will be generated in the repository root. You can install it
using your system's package manager, for example::

    $ sudo yum install measuro-devel-x.y-z.rpm

Or::

    $ sudo dpkg -i measuro-devel-x.y-z.deb

If you don't want to - or can't - use a development package, you can copy the 
buildable version of the Measuro header file to your source tree. To do this,
from the repository root::

    $ cmake ./
    $ cp build/src/measuro.hpp /your/app/src

Note that the way you include the Measuro header file in your source will 
differ depending on whether or not you are using a development package. 

If you are using a development package, you will need to::

    #include <measuro/measuro.hpp>

If you have copied the buildable Measuro header into your own source tree, you
will need to::

    #include "measuro.hpp"

**Documentation**

Comprehensive Measuro documentation is located at: 
<https://measuro.readthedocs.io/en/0.1.0/>

To build the documentation in the Measuro repository locally, from the 
repository root::

    $ doxygen
    $ cd docs
    $ make html

In-code HTML documentation will be written to ``docs/code/html`` and 
user/developer HTML documentation will be written to ``docs/build/html``.

Running the Tests
-----------------

To run the static analysis, unit tests and system test, from the 
repository root::

    $ cmake ./
    $ make
    $ make test

To run the benchmarking program, from the repository root::

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ./
    $ make measuro_benchmark_testexe
    $ test/benchmark/measuro_benchmark_testexe
